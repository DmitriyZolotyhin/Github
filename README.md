Java calculator for annuity payments, the program starts and runs, but there are logical errors in the calculations:

1) The total monthly payment when you make the amount of X = X + splatega, if you do not make the amount = X (X is calculated with 1 times and changed only after entering the amount, but if the amount is not amended X = X).
2) the principal amount of residue when the program is completed, should not have a negative value.
